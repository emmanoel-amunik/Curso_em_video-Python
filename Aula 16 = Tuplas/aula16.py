# ---------organizing and enumerating tuples-------------

snack = ('Hamburger', 'Juice', 'Pizza', 'Pudding')

for food in snack:  # the basic
    print(f"I'll eat {food}!")

for food, pos in enumerate(snack):  # 1ยบ method
    print(f"I'll eat {food} in position {pos}")  # to enumerate

for cont in range(0, len(snack)):  # 2ยบ method
    print(f"I'll eat {snack[cont]} in position {cont}")  # to enumerate

# ---------adding tuples----------

a = (2, 5, 4)
b = (5, 8, 1, 2)
c = a + b  # the order changes the result
print(c)
print(len(c))  # the number of elements in this tuple
print(c.count(5))  # how many times "5" appear in this tuple
print(c.index(8))  # what position is the 8 in
print(c.index(5, 1))  # position with displacement (starting from position "1")

# --------letters and numbers--------

person = ('John', 39, 'M', 99.88)
print(person)
